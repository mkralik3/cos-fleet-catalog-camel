# This script builds and deploys the OCM Sendgrid Service. In order to
# work, it needs the following variables defined in the CI/CD configuration of
# the project:
#
# QUAY_USER - The name of the robot account used to push images to
# 'quay.io', for example 'openshift-unified-hybrid-cloud+jenkins'.
#
# QUAY_TOKEN - The token of the robot account used to push images to
# 'quay.io'.
#
# The machines that run this script need to have access to internet, so that
# the built images can be pushed to quay.io.
